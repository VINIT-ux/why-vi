            <h1>Design Brief</h1>
            <p>The goal was to design a comprehensive yet user-friendly dashboard tailored for general aviation pilots. The dashboard needed to centralize essential information like flight planning, aircraft status, real time weather, and communication tools‚Äîall while maintaining a clean, accessible interface suitable for high-pressure aviation environments. <br>
    
                <br>
                Key objectives included:
                Simplify pre- and post-flight tasks
                Show real-time data and alerts
                Improve team coordination
                Highlight safety-critical info
                Support desktop and tablet use
                Build for future expansion (training, analytics) <br>
                
                <br>The final product had to support tablet interfaces, adhere to aviation safety standards, and be adaptable for future features like training modules and fleet analytics. <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pilots and crew faced several challenges critical flight data was hard to access quickly, pre-flight processes were scattered and time-consuming, and communication between team members was often disjointed. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Existing dashboards were cluttered and not optimized for cockpit use, with no real-time sync to keep everyone aligned.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To solve these issues, we designed a modular dashboard that surfaces key flight data at a glance, streamlining access during crucial moments. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pre-flight tasks were unified into a single, intuitive flow with smart inputs. We introduced real-time sync and a shared team view to improve coordination. The interface was kept clean and minimal, with a dark mode for better visibility and reduced strain in cockpit environments.
