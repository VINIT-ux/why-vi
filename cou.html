            <h1>The Story Behind the App</h1>
            <p>Every day, millions of home cooks whip up amazing dishes‚Äîbut their creativity often stays hidden behind kitchen doors. While social media gives a glimpse, there was no dedicated space for food lovers to truly connect, grow, and celebrate their cooking journeys. <br>
    
                <br>We saw an opportunity: What if there was a fun, gamified space just for home cooks? A place to earn rewards, level up your skills, and connect with a like-minded community. <br>
                
                <br>That‚Äôs why we built this platform‚Äîto empower home chefs, make cooking more fun, and turn everyday meals into social, shareable moments. <br>
                
                <br>Because cooking at home isn't just about food‚Äîit's about expression, connection, and joy.</p>
